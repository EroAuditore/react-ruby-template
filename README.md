# Blog-app API End-Points RoR

In this project, we transformed the original Blog app into an back-end server, providing it with some API endpoints to a to allow it to be used in different ways, rather than just through the site - for example, a mobile app or a CLI application.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.0
- Ruby on Rails v5.2.6

## Live Demo

TBA

### Prerequisites

- Ruby: 2.7.0
- Rails: 5.2.6

This creates a commented config/application.yml file and adds it to your .gitignore. Add your own configuration to this file and you're done!

Given the following configuration file you'll have to add this variables and write your own password and user to connect to DB:

# config/application.yml

>
> prod_psql_uid: postgres_user<br>
> prod_psql_pwd: Mypsqlpassword<br>

```
    rails db:seed
